Sword and Sorcery is an RPG Text Adventure Engine.

It is built using graph theory to create locations and establish connections. 

Right now, there is a specific json.file structure associated with it that can be used to build a world (add locations and connections). I am planning on adding UI elements to do this better.

In the future, I would also like to incorporate Dijkstras algorithm for quest route finding.

Other Missing functionality:
Combat, Single use items for the inventory (Like rope, torches, potions etc...) and their use cases, Resting (Heals endurance to maximum)
